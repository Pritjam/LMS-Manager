# LMS-Manager
Manager bot for the LMS server.

You will need a file called `api_key` in the same directory as `bot.py`, and that needs to contain PRIT's api key. Obviously, it's not in the repository; Contact PRIT to get the key if you want to run the bot from your own computer for any reason. Alternately, you can get your own API key from Discord.
